HR3Edits said I am also working on a gaming lounge for this discord server, I currently host it as a repl.

Feel free to take a look at the website. The login system works with discord.
Currently the login is for assigning roles to your account for specific games.

I do want to implement more in the website but I am currently out of ideas so feel free to throw in a suggestion. at 12:15:22
